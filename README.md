## Small Battery Charger

A simple to use, simple to install battery charger for placing on your submarines after
a campaign has already started.

It requires tin, copper, plastic, and an FPGA circuit to craft

Engineers and research outposts may sometimes sell them for a price of 300 marks

## Storage Containers

For all of you mining junkies and resource hoarders, this is the storage solution you never knew you wanted: colored containers!  There are four new containers in the game, medical, military, material, and hazmat.

Craftable for the same price as the base container, they offer no changes over the regular container other than to keep your storage facilities looking clean and orderly.

Depending on the outpost, they are also available for purchase at the same price, different outposts will have different containers in stock.
