[h2]Small Battery Charger[/h2][hr]
A simple to use, simple to install battery charger for placing on your submarine after a campaign has already started.

It requires tin, copper, plastic, and an FPGA circuit to craft

Engineers and research outposts may sometimes sell them for 300 marks
[h2]Storage Containers[/h2][hr]
For all your inventory management needs: color coded containers! Four new in total,
one for each of the major components you're likely to have way too much of on your sub.

Craftable for the same price as a base container, they offer no changes over the regular container other than keeping things tidy.
Depending on the outpost, they are also available for sale at the same price, different outposts will have different containers in stock.
